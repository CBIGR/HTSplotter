File name: drugscreen_1timepoint

HTSplotter Categorizes the experiments as follows: 
	 drug => Concentration >= 2; Condition = "Condition"; Combination = 0 
	 drug combination => Condition = "Condition"; Combination != 0 
	 genetic perturbagen => Concentration = 1; Condition = "Condition" ; Combination = 0 
	 genetic-chemical perturbagen => Condition != "Condition"; Combination !=0 

Based on the input file the categorization is : drug_screen

	 number of concentration for each compound: 14;14;14;

	 combination: 

	 control: Control_DMSO_Prexasertib Control_DMSO_BAY1895344 Control_DMSO_MK-1775 

	 condition: Condition 

	 the number of time points is: 1	72.0
