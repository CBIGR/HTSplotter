HTSplotter Categorizes the experiments as follows: 
	 drug => Concentration >3; Condition = "Condition"; Combination = 0 
	 drug combination => Condition = "Condition"; Combination != 0 
	 genetic perturbagen => Concentration = 1; Condition = "Condition" ; Combination = 0 
	 genetic-chemical perturbagen => Condition != "Condition"; Combination !=0 

Based on the input file the categorization is : drug_screen
