File name: genetic-chemical_perturbagen_1time_point

HTSplotter Categorizes the experiments as follows: 
	 drug => Concentration >= 2; Condition = "Condition"; Combination = 0 
	 drug combination => Condition = "Condition"; Combination != 0 
	 genetic perturbagen => Concentration = 1; Condition = "Condition" ; Combination = 0 
	 genetic-chemical perturbagen => Condition != "Condition"; Combination !=0 

Based on the input file the categorization is : genetic-chemical_perturbagen

	 number of concentration for each compound: 7;7;7;7;7;7;1;1;1;

	 combination: Drug-A_GeneOff Drug-B_GeneOff Drug-C_GeneOff DMSO_Drug-C_GeneOff DMSO_Drug-B_GeneOff DMSO_Drug-A_GeneOff CellsOnly_GeneOff 

	 control: Control_DMSO_Drug-C Control_DMSO_Drug-B Control_DMSO_Drug-A 

	 condition: Condition GeneOff 

	 the number of time points is: 1	72.0
